Code for leveraging a Google Colab to deploy FedML's federated machine learning training.

Blog post https://blog.tensoropera.ai/fedml-octopus-getting-started-federated-machine-learning/

In this blogpost, I demonstrate how to start using FedML Octopus MLOps solution to run several rounds of federated training and aggregation for a machine learning model through an Image Classification demo. The demo is intended for a first-time FedML Octopus MLOps user. The detailed instructions and No-Code approach are suitable for a researcher, engineer, solution architect, data scientist, or business stakeholder with CLI access. The result is a federated machine learning training run on a client and server youâ€™ll set up. With the pre-requisites in place, this demo should take less than 20 minutes end-to-end.

The goal is 3 fold:
1. Learn the components & flow of the FedML MLOps federated machine learning solution
1. Have FedML up and running
1. Train the demo model on your edge silo devices
